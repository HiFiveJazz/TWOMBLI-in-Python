# TWOMBLI-in-Python
TWOMBLI is an open source FIJI macro for image analysis, however, is limited in its ability to contribute due to its limitations as a FIJI macro. This project is to rewrite the code in Python while implementing a GUI frontend for additional ease of use, while also helping making it easier to contribute to it in the future.
